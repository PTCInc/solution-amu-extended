# Disclaimer

To broaden collaboration and facilitate the adoption and expansion of customer solutions, PTC is sharing several field-developed IoT components. 

These artifacts are built using ThingWorx best practices, including the Building Block structure where appropriate, and are available to PTC Customers, Partners, and Customer Success for incorporation and enhancement as needed for specific use cases.

Please note, these components are not covered by PTC Technical Support and are not subject to any Technical Support Service Level Agreements (SLAs). 

However, PTC Customer Success teams and resources will, on a best-effort basis:

* Maintain and manage functionality across ThingWorx platform version releases.
* Actively address reported bugs.
* Continue to enhance functionality opportunistically and by request where possible.

ThingWorx subscription users can continue to log technical support tickets. ThingWorx Platform Technical Support will assist in isolating root causes and addressing platform-related product issues through standard ThingWorx platform maintenance. 

If the issue pertains to this specific component offered via PTC GitHub, PTC Support will direct inquiries to the appropriate internal PTC teams for further assistance.

These shared components are provided "as is," without any warranty, express or implied, including but not limited to the warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, and non-infringement.

# Overview

Overview 

AMU-Extended offers adopters the ability to integrate statistical process control (SPC) analysis into the AMU platform. As tag values are captured, analyze them with the ThingWorx Analytics SPC module, fully integrated into the UI and database of AMU.  

AMU SPC uses the Western Electric rule set to provide the ability to monitor tags tracking statistical variation and enabling the ability to improve equipment performance using these results. Distinguish between common cause and special cause variation using the new SPC reporting embedded in AMU. Track SPC ruleset violations grouped by Line, Asset, or against a specific attribute. Visualize trends using a series of configurable XBAR, R Chart, and Capability charting options. Measure CP and CPK. Annotate anomalous data points, including an option to exclude from analysis. Includes administrative suite to tune the SPC analysis to your needs.
